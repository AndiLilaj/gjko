# What's GjKo?
 GjKo is short for **Gj**uhe **Ko**ti, in my language that means Useless language. 
 GjKo is a C-like strongly written static language with some basic features


#### "Features"
* C-like syntax
* variable bindings
* arithmetic expressions
* built-in functions
* first-class and higher-order functions
* closures
* a string data structure
* an array data structure
* a hash data structure

>Well, that doesn't seem to be the next c++, what's the point?

Obviously, as i stated, this is a useless language to program, but the interpreter I wrote is very useful, to ✨**learn**✨from.

So, if you want i humbly invite you to check the source code.
And i also recommend to read the books of Robert Nystorm and Thorsten Ball.
